# Low Latency High Performance Matching Engine built using Rust

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a centralized crypto exchange Trading Platform using Rust. This is experimental project for educational purposes, not intended to become a production system.

Each component of the system will be built as a separate crate.

## Introduction

The first step in creating a complex system is to understand the requirements of the system. The requirements of a trading system can be broken down into several categories. These categories include the trading system, market information, accounting, onramps & offramps, and risk management. Each of these systems has its own set of requirements and each of these systems has its own set of architectural requirements.

## Architectural Requirements

### Trading system
    
A trading system in an exchange, encompassing the matching engine and the order book, is the core of the operational infrastructure designed to facilitate the buying and selling of financial instruments, such as stocks, bonds, derivatives, commodities, and currencies. A breakdown of its major components:

1. **Matching Engine**: The core component of a trading system, the matching engine is responsible for the execution of orders submitted by market participants. It operates by matching buy and sell orders based on predefined criteria, such as price and time priority. The matching engine processes orders in real-time or near-real-time, ensuring that trades are executed fairly and efficiently. Its primary functions include order matching, trade confirmation, and maintaining the integrity and transparency of the trading process.

2. **Order Book**: The order book is a digital storage system that records all active buy and sell orders for a particular financial instrument on the exchange. Orders are typically organized by price level, with buy orders arranged in descending order of price and sell orders in ascending order. The order book provides a real-time snapshot of market demand and supply for an asset, showing the depth of the market, which includes information on the number of shares or contracts available at different price levels. It is essential for market participants, as it helps them make informed trading decisions by assessing market liquidity, depth, and potential price movements.

The trading system is should ensure a fair, transparent, and efficient market. It supports various types of orders, such as market orders, limit orders, stop orders, and others, each with specific instructions on how they should be executed. The system's performance, including its speed, reliability, and capacity to handle high volumes of orders without significant delays or disruptions, is crucial for maintaining market integrity and trader confidence.

Moreover, the trading system is subject to rigorous regulatory standards to protect investors, prevent market manipulation, and ensure compliance with trading rules. This involves continuous monitoring, auditing, and updating of the system to address emerging challenges and technological advancements in the financial markets so the design must embrace the flexibility this requires.

### Market Information

The Market Information System within an exchange serves as a critical intermediary layer, tasked with aggregating, processing, and disseminating vital market data to participants in real-time or near-real-time. This system plays a pivotal role in ensuring transparency, facilitating informed decision-making, and maintaining a fair and efficient marketplace. Hereâ€™s an expanded definition incorporating its components, functionality, and significance:

1. **Data Aggregation and Processing**: The Market Information System collects data from various sources within the exchange, primarily from the trading system's matching engine and order book. This includes detailed information on executed trades, current open orders (buy and sell), order modifications, cancellations, and the real-time status of financial instruments being traded. The system processes this raw data to generate meaningful market insights, such as the current minimum ask price, maximum bid price, volume of orders at different price levels, the last traded price, and historical trade data.

2. **Real-Time Market Data Feeds**: At the heart of the system is its ability to provide a continuous stream of market data to users. This includes real-time quotes for securities, market depth information showing the volume of orders at various price levels, and transaction reports detailing executed trades. The immediacy of this information is crucial for traders and investors to make timely and informed decisions.

3. **Data Dissemination Methods**: To ensure broad accessibility and usability of market information, the system employs standardized protocols for data dissemination. REST APIs (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interfaces) and WebSockets are commonly used for delivering data over the internet, offering users flexibility in accessing real-time or historical market data. The system may also support industry-standard protocols such as the Financial Information eXchange (FIX) protocol, which is widely used for real-time electronic exchange of securities transactions and market data.

4. **Data Visualization and Analytics Tools**: Beyond raw data feeds, the Market Information System often integrates advanced data visualization and analytics tools. These tools help users interpret market trends, analyze trading volumes and price movements, and visualize market sentiment. They can range from simple charting tools to sophisticated analytical platforms offering complex indicators and predictive modeling capabilities.

5. **Compliance and Security**: Ensuring the integrity, reliability, and security of market data is paramount. The system incorporates mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access, data manipulation, and other security threats. Compliance with regulatory standards is also critical, necessitating features for audit trails, data accuracy checks, and mechanisms to prevent the dissemination of sensitive information.

6. **User Accessibility and Customization**: Catering to a diverse user base, from individual traders to large institutional investors, the Market Information System offers customizable data feeds and interfaces. Users can select specific data points, customize their data streams to match their trading strategies, and integrate market data into their own trading platforms or applications.

7. **Latency and Scalability**: With traders relying on split-second timing, the system is optimized for low latency, ensuring that data is delivered as quickly as possible. Scalability is also crucial, as the system must handle peak trading volumes and surges in data requests without degradation in performance.

### Accounts, Onramps & Offramps
